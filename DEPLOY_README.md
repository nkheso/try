MyStudyTask Master - Deployment Package
Included:
- deepseek_html_20251006_46ad82.html

Quick deployment options:

1) Serve locally (quick test)
   - Python 3 (in the same folder as the HTML):
     python3 -m http.server 8000
   - Open http://localhost:8000/deepseek_html_20251006_46ad82.html

2) GitHub Pages (free, simple)
   - Create a GitHub repo (e.g., mystudytask)
   - Add this HTML file to the repository root (rename to index.html if you want it served at the root)
   - Commit & push
   - In repo Settings > Pages, select branch 'main' (or 'gh-pages') and root folder '/'
   - Wait a minute, then visit https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ (or if file is index.html in root, https://<your-username>.github.io/)

3) Netlify (drag & drop)
   - Go to netlify.com and sign up
   - Drag & drop deploy_package.zip or the single HTML file into the Netlify UI (Sites > New site from deploy > drag & drop)
   - Netlify gives you a public URL immediately

4) Vercel (for static sites)
   - Sign up at vercel.com
   - Import Git repository OR use their 'Deploy' button and upload the project
   - If using a single HTML file, set it as index.html or point to the file

5) Replit (live preview + editor)
   - Create a new Replit, choose 'Static' template or 'HTML, CSS, JS'
   - Upload the HTML file into the project and run; copy the public URL

Notes & tips:
- If you want the site to be visible at the root (/) of your domain, rename the file to index.html before deploying.
- For reminders/notification behaviors, some features (sound, persistent timers) require hosting over HTTPS for certain APIs (Notifications, Service Workers).
- If you plan to make the app interactive across users, you'll need a backend and database â€” these deployment suggestions are for static hosting.
